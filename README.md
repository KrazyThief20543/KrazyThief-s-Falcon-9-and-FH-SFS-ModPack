# KrazyThief's Falcon 9 and FH SFS *ModPack*:

The Pipes in side boosters were traced over Alivuah's work: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#/media/File:F9_and_Heavy_visu.png

This is a modpack for the falcon 9 and soon the falcon heavy rockets that were made by SpaceX, with unique features like changing ISP of Engine, changing nozzle and changing logos on the upper fuel tank.

# THIS IS UNFINISHED so bewary of bugs/left out features! Also, as of writing, I plan to slightly rework gridfins to add more detail and more :p. 

## Planning to add following:

- RCS [Done]
- Stage 2 Fuel Tank and Engine with togglabe shorter variant [Done] {Planning to add more detail}
- Falcon Fairing with logo toggle [Kinda Done]
- Block Heavy variant [Done]
- Grid fins [Done]
- Landing Legs [Done]
- Interstage [Done]
- Custom engine sounds [Done]
- Custom plumes [Done]
- Making landing legs and Gridfins extend and retract facing the viewer [Done]
- Possibly adding pipes and a toggle for variants... [Done]
- Toggle For Block and non Block Variants of fuel tanks and side boosters [Kinda Done] {Don't forget Falcon 5 and Falcon 1.0 and 1.1v}
- Correctly Order parts once done [Need to do]


p.s. I thank Mac, Cryptowave, PrimeAerospace, Picospace Industries, Brioche and VaporSpace For helping me getting into sfs modding as I was an **ABSOLUTE** beginner to unity and making mods üëç
(Make sure to check their mods out as well).
